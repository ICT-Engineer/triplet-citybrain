# Test Book · Triplet 07

Every scenario has one trigger command, and each run writes `logs/<id>-<UTC time>.log` (R2). Each log holds the timestamped timeline (R3), the decisions, the offline vault state and a PASS/FAIL line for every expected output below.

**Status:** these are the City Brain scenarios. They run against the Brain's built-in Twin and Guardian simulators (R1). The layers are **not merged yet**. The Twin team's own scenarios T5 and SCN-02 … SCN-06 are reproduced here with the same names and the same expected Brain behaviour, so the team can rerun them against the real layers on merge day.

| ID | Name | Last result |
|---|---|---|
| CALM-01 | Calm day: the Brain must not overreact | PASS (`logs/`) |
| T5 | Fake flood at the port | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SCN-02 | Real flash flood: start the linked pump | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SCN-03 | Dead and frozen sensors: use the backup | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SCN-04 | Quarantined pump: use the backup pump | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SCN-05 | Real accident and spoofed air alarm | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SCN-06 | Guardian outage: hold, never fabricate | PASS (`logs/`) |
| AIR-01 | Industrial smog: air model curtails the plant | PASS (`logs/`) |
| AIR-02 | Downtown haze: advisory only | PASS (`logs/`) |
| NET-01 | Link lost after deciding: offline vault | PASS (`logs/`) |
| SEC-01 | Command shield: tampering, replay, bad commands | PASS (`logs/`) |
| INP-01 | Malformed partner input | PASS (`logs/`) |
| EMG-01 | Emergency call: route responders | PASS (`logs/`) |

Run everything with `python scenarios/run.py --all` (on Windows, `RUN_ALL_SCENARIOS.cmd`).
